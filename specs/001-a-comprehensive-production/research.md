# Research for RAG Toolkit

## Performance Goals

*   **Task:** Research and define specific, measurable performance goals for the RAG toolkit.
*   **Details:** The current requirement is "fast", which is ambiguous. We need to define concrete latency targets (e.g., P95, P99 latency in milliseconds) for the question-answering functionality.

## Scale/Scope

*   **Task:** Research and define the expected scale and scope of the RAG toolkit.
*   **Details:** The current requirement is "scalable to a large number of documents and users". We need to define specific targets for the number of documents, the size of the documents, and the number of concurrent users the system should support.
