# Feature Specification: RAG Toolkit

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-comprehensive-production`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A comprehensive, production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) toolkit that enables intelligent document retrieval and question-answering capabilities. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, supporting multiple data sources and vector databases."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Which file formats should be supported? ‚Üí A: url, txt
- Q: Which vector databases should be supported? ‚Üí A: faiss
- Q: What are the specific performance targets and scale? ‚Üí A: fast

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user can provide a set of documents and ask questions about them to get intelligent answers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a collection of documents, **When** a user asks a question relevant to the documents, **Then** the system should provide a concise and accurate answer based on the document content.
2. **Given** a new data source (e.g., a new set of files), **When** the user adds it to the system, **Then** the system should be able to answer questions based on the new data.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user asks a question that is not related to the documents?
- How does the system handle very large documents or a very large number of documents?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to ingest documents from multiple data sources.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support `url` and `txt` file formats.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to ask questions in natural language.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide answers based on the content of the ingested documents.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support the `faiss` vector database.
- **FR-006**: The system's retrieval and generation components MUST be modular.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST be scalable and provide fast responses. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: "fast" is still ambiguous. What are the specific latency targets in milliseconds for P95 and P99?].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document**: Represents a single piece of content ingested into the system. Attributes: source, content, metadata.
- **DataSource**: Represents a source of documents, e.g., a file folder, a database, a Notion workspace.
- **VectorStore**: Represents the vector database used for storing document embeddings.
- **Query**: Represents a user's question.
- **Answer**: Represents the system's response to a query.
